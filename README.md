# video-playlist-in-browser

This is a template. I used it for two repos: mogul-christmas and duck-song.

I commented out what you need to do to use it yourself.

It's basically just taking a video with a bunch of songs in it, and in the js const those songs and in the share or embed screen tap start at, time in the video. For example the song Hey Jude from the Beatles starts at 8 seconds so const the song name and then the time it starts in the video.
